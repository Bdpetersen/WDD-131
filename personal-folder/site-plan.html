            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                The purpose of this website is to create a professional online portfolio to showcase my photography work. 
                It will serve as a central hub where I can display high-quality images taken with my Canon camera, allowing me to share my hobby 
                with friends and family, and demonstrate my creative skills to potential employers.
            </p>
            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>
                The primary audience includes photography enthusiasts, friends, family, and potential clients looking for a photographer. 
                They will access the site from both desktop computers and mobile devices, so the site must be fully responsive. 
                They are looking for a clean, visual-heavy experience where they can easily filter photos by category (e.g., Nature vs. Urban).
            </p>
            <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
            <p>
                I will use JavaScript to dynamically generate the photo gallery on the secondary page.
                <br><br>
                1. <strong>ES Modules:</strong> I will store my photo data in a separate file (<code>photos.js</code>) and import it into my main script.
                <br>
                2. <strong>Objects & Arrays:</strong> My data will be an array of objects. Each object will represent a photo with properties like <code>id</code>, <code>category</code>, <code>src</code>, and <code>description</code>.
                <br>
                3. <strong>Array Methods:</strong> I will use <code>.map()</code> to generate the HTML cards for the gallery and <code>.filter()</code> to let users sort images by category buttons.
            </p>

            <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
            <p>
                Photography is the art of capturing light. This website is designed to let the images speak for themselves.
                By using a clean font like Open Sans, we ensure that the text supports the visuals rather than distracting from them.
                Each gallery item will feature a short description explaining the setting and equipment used.
            </p>
            <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
            <p class="colored">
                This is how text will look when placed over our primary color background. 
                It is important to ensure high contrast for accessibility, making sure all visitors can read the descriptions of the photos easily.
