// Step 1: Create a basic main.js file. 
// This file can import and run code from recipes.mjs later.

import recipes from './recipes.mjs';

// Currently, it's just a placeholder, but it ensures the script link works.
console.log('main.js loaded.');

// You would add JavaScript code here in later steps (Part 2 and 3) 
// to render the recipe list, handle search, etc.
